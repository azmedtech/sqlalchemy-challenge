## Project Summary

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. To take to accomplish this task...you will need to perform the following:

### Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

Use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### Part 2: Design Your Climate App

Design a Flask API based on the queries that you just developed. To do so, use Flask to create your routes as follows:

* /api/v1.0/precipitation: Returns the precipitation data for the last year.
* /api/v1.0/stations: Returns the list of stations from the dataset.
* /api/v1.0/tobs: Returns the date and temperature observations from the most active station over the previous year.
* /api/v1.0/<start>: Returns the minimum, maximum, and average temperature observations from a given start date through the end of the dataset.
* /api/v1.0/<start>/<end>: Returns the minimum, maximum, and average temperature observations between given start and end dates.

### Collaboration
* Code debugging: ASU Learning Assistants
* Dictionary code for <start> and <start>/>end> routes: Classmates FS and JB
